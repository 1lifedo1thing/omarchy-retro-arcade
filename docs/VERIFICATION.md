# Consolidation verification

## Verified locally

- All 120 Rust tests pass across the combined workspace, including real Stockfish communication, save compatibility, deterministic rules, card artwork validation and bounded Pinball frame decoding.
- Formatting and Clippy with warnings denied pass for all workspace targets.
- Original Pinball engine tests pass for a full three-ball game, ramp, target, orbit and drain collisions, finite/bounded ball state, and operation without proprietary DAT resources.
- Native X11/XTest checks confirm a single window across five games, singleton locking, Solitaire draw/save/reopen, original save-directory identities, Pinball launch/flipper input, confirmed return to the shelf, and clean shutdown.
- Actual native screenshots are under `docs/screenshots`.

## Remaining gates

- Clean Arch package installation/reinstallation and CI results for the consolidated revision.
- Real Omarchy/Wayland desktop acceptance: sound, fractional scaling, low-end CPU/GPU performance, Pinball input latency and game difficulty.

This is a development preview. Headless Linux verification is not a real Omarchy desktop playtest.
